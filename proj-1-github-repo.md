# MCP Server Breakdown: Interview Project

## Project Overview

Build a single-page web application that analyzes Model Context Protocol (MCP) server repositories from GitHub. The application should extract and visualize the architecture, tools, prompts, and resources defined within the server implementation.

**Applicant's Choice:** You may select how you'd like to complete this challenge \- either as a live coding session or as a take-home project.

## Project Options

**You may choose one of the following options to complete this project:**

1. **Live Rapid Vibe Code Screen Share**: \~1 hour coding session where you build the solution in real-time with our team  
2. **Take-Home Project**: \~3 hours to complete at your own pace and submit when ready

## Requirements

### Core Functionality

1. **GitHub Repository Analysis**:  
     
   - Allow users to enter a GitHub repository URL for an MCP server implementation  
   - Pull and parse the repository contents  
   - Extract MCP server components (tools, prompts, resources)

   

2. **Visualization & Breakdown**:  
     
   - Display a structured breakdown of the MCP server architecture  
   - List all registered tools with their descriptions and parameters  
   - Show defined prompts and resources  
   - Visualize the hierarchical structure of the server components

   

3. **Technical Analysis**:  
     
   - Generate a brief architectural analysis of the implementation  
   - Identify patterns used in the server design  
   - Highlight interesting or unique aspects of the implementation

### Technical Requirements

- Single-page web application  
- Frontend: Any modern framework (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)  
- Backend: Optional, can be serverless or a lightweight API  
- GitHub API integration for repository access  
- Code parsing and analysis capabilities

## Evaluation Criteria

We'll evaluate your solution based on:

1. **Functionality**: Does it successfully analyze and break down MCP servers?  
2. **Code Quality**: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?  
3. **Architecture**: Is the application designed thoughtfully?  
4. **UX/UI**: Is the interface intuitive and effective?  
5. **Technical Insight**: Does the analysis provide valuable insights?  
6. **Performance**: Does it handle repositories efficiently?

## Submission Guidelines

### Live Coding Option

- Come prepared to build the core functionality within the 1-hour timeframe  
- You can use any development environment and tools you prefer  
- Be ready to explain your design choices during the session

### Take-Home Option

- Submit a GitHub repository with your solution  
- Include a README with setup instructions and any relevant documentation  
- Provide a brief write-up of your approach and any challenges you faced  
- Complete the project within 3 days of receiving it

## Example Repositories

You may test your application with these public MCP server implementations:

- GitHub MCP Server: [https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server)  
- GitLab MCP Server: [https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) (src/gitlab directory)  
- Twilio MCP Server: [https://github.com/twilio-labs/mcp](https://github.com/twilio-labs/mcp)

## Deliverables

1. Working single-page web application  
2. Source code with documentation  
3. Brief presentation of your solution (5 minutes max)

Good luck\! We're excited to see your approach to this challenge.
